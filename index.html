  I'm writing this blog because I believe that Bayesian methods in general, and sampling methods and Bayesian nonparametrics in particular, deserve a much higher profile in data analytics and commercial machine learning. In my professional life, I'm working to productize these methods and apply them to particular high-value business problems.

  <p>
  But these techniques can and should be in the toolbox of every data scientist or developer who needs to understand data.  I want to provide the hacker's perspective, not the statistician's.  My goal is to give enough background and motivation for you to learn and experiment on your own, along with tips and recipes to get you solving your own problems.

  Please, please let me know how I can do better.
