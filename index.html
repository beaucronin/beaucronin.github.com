  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>After receiving my <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/45336">PhD in computational neuroscience</a> from MIT in 2008, I co-founded two companies based on probabilistic inference; both were backed by the crazy folks at <a href="http://foundersfund.com">Founders Fund</a>. The second, Prior Knowledge, was acquired by <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> in late 2012, where I now work as a product manager.</p>
  <p>I live in Oakland, CA with my wife and daughter.</p>
  <p><a href="http://twitter.com/beaucronin">Twitter</a> is the best way to get a hold of me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>Writing</h1>
  I've been doing some writing, mostly about where I see machine learning and intelligent systems heading in the coming years. I hope to play some role in these developments.
