  I'm writing this blog because I believe that Bayesian methods in general, and sampling methods and Bayesian nonparametrics in particular, deserve a much higher profile in data analytics and commercial machine learning. In my professional life, I'm working to bring productive these methods and apply them to particular high-value business problems.

  But I believe that this approach can and should be adopted by a wide range of people - potentially, and developer or data scientist who needs to understand data.  This is the hacker's perspective, not the statistician.  My goal is to provide enough background and motivation for you to learn and experiment on your own, along with as many recipes as possible to get you started quickly toward solving your own problems.

  Please, please let me know how I can do better.
